# RunpodSD-Customizer
Load all your models and loras in one click on Runpod

I created this Python script to load all my models and loras and such in a Runpod running the SD-Template from Runpod (not the fast one). Of course you could just pay for the storage and leave your setup as is, but I didn't want to do that.

Copy the script and link your favourite models at the appropiate places.
Just upload this script to your /workspace directory and let it do it's thing.
You still have to make custom command line arguments in the webui-user.sh file, and maybe change the port if you restart.
after doing all that, you start the web-ui using relauncher.py included in the template

## Disclaimer
I do not have a lot of experience in python. So this may very well be very bad code. 
If it helps you and you get to improve it, let me know. For now it works for me, but there shure is room for improvement.
